# InventoryManagementUi

This is a project I started so that I could learn Angular. It is very barebones right now and I work on it when I have the time and energy. It is going to be a simple asset management and maintenance tracking system.

This repository contains a basic Angular project defining the UI. It is using Angular 9 and Bootstrap. I am trying to avoid using too many other libraries.

The backend is a separate service written in SpringBoot. It is located here: https://github.com/mwtremblay/springboot-inventory-management-service
